## Description

This is my personal portfolio page, utilizing React, React router, and Vite to support a single-page application with my web development credentials. I added styling such as a simple logo, 
a dedicated color scheme, and some texture via background images in the CSS. Chakra UI components are used for several of the buttons, text fields, and other components. 

- I created this site to display my coding skills and eye for design within a chosen color scheme. This site gives potential employers a lot of information including my tech proficiencies, a portfolio of my full-stack apps and personal projects including 3 games, and various available forms of contact including links to social media. 
- This was my first single-page React application using React router. It was good practice for using the Chakra component library, React, and media queries using a combination of basic CSS and Chakra UI responsive design controls. I took my time with the CSS to develop a textured and cohesive look to demonstrate my eye for design and current CSS abilities to potential employers. 
- This application puts a lot of information useful to employers in a convenient place, while showcasing my passion for coding. 
- I learned about onBlur effects, Chakra UI queries, using multiple CSS background images in combination, React router, Netlify deployment, and many basic React concepts.
