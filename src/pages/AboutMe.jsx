                        I am a web developer in the Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina area with proficiency in front and back end web technologies.
                        I produce strategically-coded content with attention to issues of scale and code sustainability. 
                        I strive to optimize the accessibility of my web content by continuously learning about the needs of
                        diverse individuals.  I am an inspired developer who brings passion and creativity to a team development environment.
